JustLight Theme for webtrees
============================

A light clean theme using the Bootstrap framework.
This theme requires [webtrees 1.6.2](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees). Download the latest stable release [here](https://github.com/JustCarmen/justlight/releases/tag/1.6.2.1).

Description
-----------
This is a new modern theme in clean white and blue. The layout is adjusted as much as possible for use on touch devices like tablets and mobile phones.

A few things to mention:
* The menu is responsive. This means it will collapse on smaller screens and have only clickable items. You might be used to hover over a menu item to get it’s submenu but on touch devices the hover functionality doesn’t exist.

* The homepage and mypage are responsive as long as you keep some things in mind. Using the statistics block for instance means the page cannot shrink on smaller devices.

* At the individual page the sidebar will collapse automatically when viewing from smaller screens.

And much more...

Like the [JustBlack theme](https://github.com/JustCarmen/justblack), this theme also have [it's own option module](https://github.com/JustCarmen/justlight_theme_options). You can opt for a compact menu, a separate media menu and/or to place the main menu items in any order you like.
