07-03-2013 - JustBlack for webtrees 1.4.0

* flexible topmenu. When text in main-menu items is too long the text will be divided into more lines in stead of cutting of text.
* bug solved. Main menu icons clickable now.
* bug solved. No gap between submenu's.
* quicker loading of the searchpages by improving the css.
* bug solved. Opacity on language flags to show difference between active and inactive languages is now working as it should.
* smooth scrolling on faq page;
* bug solved on pedigree page and hourglass page. Due to a mistake in the javascript code zooming was not working as expected.
* Moved some javascript to style popups to css (css3).
* Updated jQuery-ui.custom.css to version 1.10.0 (svn 14766).
* JQuery ui tooltips on all title attributes. This replaces the tiptip script which was used on the language flags and in the edit section
  of the medialist.
* Restyled the blocks on homepage and mypage (add silver border and shadow).
* Removed the special colors on empty items in the sidebar individual list and family list. To style these items all items needed
  to be load first to determine which items were empty. This causes extra ajax calls and slow load of the lists.
* Added colorbox support with wheelzoom function;
* Added pdf support for colorbox.
* Solved bug in configure dialogs with texteditors. Now reopening won't cause problems with the texteditor anymore.
* Moved all inline Javascript from header.php to functions.php
* Removed some javascript for styling the sidebar. Sidebar styling is now done by css.
* Changed the personbox_template to get rid of the distorted thumnails webtrees provided. In stead there are nice cropped thumnails now.
  There are cropped on the server side for quicker loading.
* Quicker loading of cufon headers.
* Recover the styling for the media-links on the medialist page wich was removed in webtrees 1.4.0.
* Removed the separate folder for lightbox support. Lightbox styling is still needed on the album tab and in the medialist page,
  so the neccessary styles and javascript are moved to style.css and justblack.js.
* Removed the extra javascript plugins (jquery.livequery.min.js, jquery.tiptip.js and jquery.url.js) from the theme/js folder. The plugins
  are not needed anymore because custom justblack functions had taken over the functionallity of the plugins. This reduced the dependence on other developpers.
========================================================================================================

24-10-2012 - JustBlack for webtrees 1.3.2 

* Followed all webtrees default changes regarding stylesheets
* Restyled error messages.
* Do not show submenu for one gedcom.
* Added icon arrow for sub-submenu items (relationship) to the submenu-sprite.
* Restyled the verify form.
* Changed the color of the placeholders to light grey.
* Changed font size for titlerow in album tab (on individual page).
* Restyled the popupscreen 'add existing media'.
* New languages added to the list of core languages: Ukrainian (uk) and Bulgarian (bg). Flags added for language menu.
* Flags deleted for languages which does not belong to the core languages anymore (af, dv, el, en-AU, fo, id, ja, ro, sr, ta, zh).
  To bring them back add the extra flags to the flags_sprite image and set the position in the css file.
* Added style for language flags menu (fade-out inactive language) and active language and active theme in dropdown menu.
* Do not show favorites text when there are no gedcom and user favorites.
* Restyled the map pane (googlemaps popup) so it fits better with the theme.
* Further restyling of the individual pages and the individual and family lists in the sidebar.

* Changed variable name 'char' in 'sChar' in justblack.js. Because char is a default javascript variable, it can cause conflicts.
* Font color in managelink popup screen was not readable. Changed color.
* Using an ajax request for individual list and family list causes slow load of individual page.
  Now the request is done only once after one has clicked the appropiate link in the sidebar the first time. The request is neccessary to style and grey out the non clickable letters in the lists.
* Silhouette images were to light for map pane (googlemaps popup). Added a background-color and border.
* Bug in webtrees: add to favorites not working from dropdown menu. This theme is the only theme using the dropdown menu for favorites. Issue solved for this theme.

09-08-2012 - JustBlack for webtrees 1.3.0 (v1.3)
* It turns out not all special characters are supported by the Salina font.
  When a known character is not supported by the font the default font will be used for the specific string.

12-06-2012 - JustBlack for webtrees 1.3.0 (v1.2)
* Fixed a bug. The special font for titles also works for special characters now. Thanks to Ardhtu for pointing that out to me.
  One file is changed: fonts/Salina_500.font.js.

09-06-2012 - JustBlack for webtrees 1.3.0 (v1.1)
* Just a minor update. Fixed wrong version number in the readme file.

07-06-2012 - JustBlack for webtrees 1.3.0

Under the hood webtrees has made a lot of changes. This theme is fully adjusted to work with webtrees 1.3.0.

* The button and icon system of webtrees has changed. Therefore the stylesheet and other JustBlack theme files are adjusted.
* From this version webtrees introduces a modal dialog box system. This theme had modified the dialog system a bit so the boxes
  are actually showing up in the middle of the page.
* Changes are made in the JustBlack theme script file (justblack.js) to work with this version of webtrees.
* The cufon code (special block and page title font) is moved to the footer script to speed up page loading.
* Modified some other styles to work with this version of webtrees.
* The clickable table cells as mentioned in the changelog of 02-06 are removed. This is not working in this version of webtrees.
* The separate file for simple view functions is removed. This is no longer neccessary in this version.
* Solved a bug in favorites menu dropdown. This causes page validation to fail.
* Moved the file lightbox/css/jb_lightbox.css to lightbox/jb_lightbox.css
* Added update instructions in the readme file.

========================================================================================================

02-06-2012 - JustBlack for webtrees 1.2.7.(v2)

* delete the file css/jquery_ui.jb.css. It is not used.
* added font-size 11px for fact_NOTE, fact_SOUR and source_citations in style.css
* added styling on families tab. The 'reorder children' tablecell and the 'add a brother or sister' tablecell are colored
  in a different style now so it is clear these are menu items. These table cells are also clickable now. Changes are made in js/justblack.js.
  For this purpose two new images added: sex_m_9x9_dark.png and sex_f_9x9_dark.png.
* Added list-style-type:none to ul#reoder_list in style.css
* Added separate file for functions which are neccessary in simple view (modal help popup box).
* Changed help popup function in justblack.js. Content is loading quicker now.

28-05-2012 - JustBlack for webtrees 1.2.7

* Template conversion to webtrees. Template will no longer be updated for PGV except for bugfixes.
* Smooth Top Navigation Menu.
* Flags for language menu in the header with a nice tooltip system. This was the standard behaviour of the JustBlack template in PGV
  but webtrees no longer support this feature by default. 
  In this template all the flags belonging to the by webtrees supported languages are implemented.  
  If there are more than 10 languages selected by default, the language menu will change in a language dropdown menu in the bottom left corner of the header.
  To reduce the number of supported languages simply delete the languages you will not use from the language folder.   
* NEW: Nice font for titles.    
* Restyled the login and register pages.
* Restyled the faq page.
* Restyled the individual pages.
* NEW: To reduce the number of browser windows popups webtrees uses by default, the Justblack theme implemented a number of nice features, 
  like the help dialog boxes and the 'change blocks on this page' dialog box on homepage and mypage.
  For admins the single blocks on the homepage and mypage can be configured in place. No other theme has these features!  
* NEW: When you put your email link in a custom textarea, just write the link like this (be sure the button 'code' is clicked when you use the texteditor):
  <a class="contact_link_admin" href="#">send me a message</a> 
  Now this custom link will use the same messagebox as the default link in the footer. No need to navigate your visitors away from your site.  
* New favicon to replace the old one.
  
* Note: Punbb and research assistant are no longer supported by the JustBlack theme because they are not a part of webtrees.

==================================================================================================
