    <p>
      HTML Purifier has a fairly complex system for configuration. Users
      interact with a <code>HTMLPurifier_Config</code> object to
      set configuration directives. The values they set are validated according
      to a configuration schema, <code>HTMLPurifier_ConfigSchema</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The schema is mostly transparent to end-users, but if you're doing development
      work for HTML Purifier and need to define a new configuration directive,
      you'll need to interact with it. We'll also talk about how to define
      userspace configuration directives at the very end.
    </p>

    <h2>Write a directive file</h2>

    <p>
      Directive files define configuration directives to be used by
      HTML Purifier. They are placed in <code>library/HTMLPurifier/ConfigSchema/schema/</code>
      in the form <code><em>Namespace</em>.<em>Directive</em>.txt</code> (I
      couldn't think of a more descriptive file extension.)
      Directive files are actually what we call <code>StringHash</code>es,
      i.e. associative arrays represented in a string form reminiscent of
      <a href="http://qa.php.net/write-test.php">PHPT</a> tests. Here's a
      sample directive file, <code>Test.Sample.txt</code>:
    </p>

    <pre>Test.Sample
TYPE: string/null
DEFAULT: NULL
ALLOWED: 'foo', 'bar'
VALUE-ALIASES: 'baz' => 'bar'
VERSION: 3.1.0
--DESCRIPTION--
This is a sample configuration directive for the purposes of the
&lt;code&gt;dev-config-schema.html&lt;code&gt; documentation.
--ALIASES--
Test.Example</pre>

    <p>
      Each of these segments has a specific meaning:
    </p>

    <table class="table">

          <td>string/null</td>
          <td>The type of variable this directive accepts. See below for

          <td>'foo', 'bar'</td>

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      Some notes on format and style:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Each of these keys can be expressed in the short format
        (<code>KEY: Value</code>) or the long format
        (<code>--KEY--</code> with value beneath). You must use the
        long format if multiple lines are needed, or if a long format
        has been used already (that's why <code>ALIASES</code> in our
        example is in the long format); otherwise, it's user preference.
      </li>
      <li>
        The HTML descriptions should be wrapped at about 80 columns; do
        not rely on editor word-wrapping.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Also, as promised, here is the set of possible types:
    </p>

    <table class="table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Type</th>
          <th>Example</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>

          <td>String with newlines</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td>"a<em>\n</em>b"</td>
          <td>Case insensitive ASCII string without newlines</td>
        </tr>

          <td>true</td>
          <td>Boolean</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>lookup</td>
          <td>array('key' =&gt; true)</td>
          <td>Lookup array, used with <code>isset($var[$key])</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>list</td>
          <td>array('f', 'b')</td>

        <tr>
          <td>hash</td>
          <td>array('key' =&gt; 'val')</td>
          <td>Associative array of keys to values</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>mixed</td>
          <td>new stdclass</td>
          <td>Any PHP variable is fine</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      The examples represent what will be returned out of the configuration
      object; users have a little bit of leeway when setting configuration
      values (for example, a lookup value can be specified as a list;
      HTML Purifier will flip it as necessary.) These types are defined
      in <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/htmlpurifier.git?a=blob;hb=HEAD;f=library/HTMLPurifier/VarParser.php">
      library/HTMLPurifier/VarParser.php</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For more information on what values are allowed, and how they are parsed,
      consult <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/htmlpurifier.git?a=blob;hb=HEAD;f=library/HTMLPurifier/ConfigSchema/InterchangeBuilder.php">
      library/HTMLPurifier/ConfigSchema/InterchangeBuilder.php</a>, as well
      as <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/htmlpurifier.git?a=blob;hb=HEAD;f=library/HTMLPurifier/ConfigSchema/Interchange/Directive.php">
      library/HTMLPurifier/ConfigSchema/Interchange/Directive.php</a> for
      the semantics of the parsed values.
    </p>

    <h2>Refreshing the cache</h2>

    <p>
      You may have noticed that your directive file isn't doing anything
      yet. That's because it hasn't been added to the runtime
      <code>HTMLPurifier_ConfigSchema</code> instance. Run
      <code>maintenance/generate-schema-cache.php</code> to fix this.
      If there were no errors, you're good to go! Don't forget to add
      some unit tests for your functionality!
    </p>

    <p>
      If you ever make changes to your configuration directives, you
      will need to run this script again.
    </p>
    <h2>Adding in-house schema definitions</h2>

    <p>
      Placing stuff directly in HTML Purifier's source tree is generally not a
      good idea, so HTML Purifier 4.0.0+ has some facilities in place to make your
      life easier.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first is to pass an extra parameter to <code>maintenance/generate-schema-cache.php</code>
      with the location of your directory (relative or absolute path will do). For example,
      if I'm storing my custom definitions in <em>/var/htmlpurifier/myschema</em>, run:
      <code>php maintenance/generate-schema-cache.php /var/htmlpurifier/myschema</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alternatively, you can create a small loader PHP file in the HTML Purifier base
      directory named <code>config-schema.php</code> (this is the same directory
      you would place a <code>test-settings.php</code> file).  In this file, add
      the following line for each directory you want to load:
    </p>

<pre>$builder-&gt;buildDir($interchange, '/var/htmlpurifier/myschema');</pre>

    <p>You can even load a single file using:</p>

<pre>$builder-&gt;buildFile($interchange, '/var/htmlpurifier/myschema/MyApp.Directive.txt');</pre>

    <p>Storing custom definitions that you don't plan on sending back upstream in
    a separate directory is <em>definitely</em> a good idea! Additionally, picking
    a good namespace can go a long way to saving you grief if you want to use
    someone else's change, but they picked the same name, or if HTML Purifier
    decides to add support for a configuration directive that has the same name.</p>

    <!-- TODO: how to name directives that rely on naming conventions -->

    <h2>Errors</h2>

    <p>
      All directive files go through a rigorous validation process
      through <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/htmlpurifier.git?a=blob;hb=HEAD;f=library/HTMLPurifier/ConfigSchema/Validator.php">
      library/HTMLPurifier/ConfigSchema/Validator.php</a>, as well
      as some basic checks during building. While
      listing every error out here is out-of-scope for this document, we
      can give some general tips for interpreting error messages.
      There are two types of errors: builder errors and validation errors.
    </p>

    <h3>Builder errors</h3>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>Exception:</strong> Expected type string, got
        integer in DEFAULT in directive hash 'Ns.Dir'
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      You can identify a builder error by the keyword "directive hash."
      These are the easiest to deal with, because they directly correspond
      with your directive file. Find the offending directive file (which
      is the directive hash plus the .txt extension), find the
      offending index ("in DEFAULT" means the DEFAULT key) and fix the error.
      This particular error would occur if your default value is not the same
      type as TYPE.
    </p>

    <h3>Validation errors</h3>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>Exception:</strong> Alias 3 in valueAliases in directive
        'Ns.Dir' must be a string
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      These are a little trickier, because we're not actually validating
      your directive file, or even the direct string hash representation.
      We're validating an Interchange object, and the error messages do
      not mention any string hash keys.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nevertheless, it's not difficult to figure out what went wrong.
      Read the "context" statements in reverse:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>in directive 'Ns.Dir'</dt>
        <dd>This means we need to look at the directive file <code>Ns.Dir.txt</code></dd>
      <dt>in valueAliases</dt>
        <dd>There's no key actually called this, but there's one that's close:
          VALUE-ALIASES. Indeed, that's where to look.</dd>
      <dt>Alias 3</dt>
        <dd>The value alias that is equal to 3 is the culprit.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      In this particular case, you're not allowed to alias integers values to
      strings values.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most difficult part is translating the Interchange member variable (valueAliases)
      into a directive file key (VALUE-ALIASES), but there's a one-to-one
      correspondence currently. If the two formats diverge, any discrepancies
      will be described in <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/htmlpurifier.git?a=blob;hb=HEAD;f=library/HTMLPurifier/ConfigSchema/InterchangeBuilder.php">
      library/HTMLPurifier/ConfigSchema/InterchangeBuilder.php</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Internals</h2>

    <p>
      Much of the configuration schema framework's codebase deals with
      shuffling data from one format to another, and doing validation on this
      data.
      The keystone of all of this is the <code>HTMLPurifier_ConfigSchema_Interchange</code>
      class, which represents the purest, parsed representation of the schema.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hand-writing this data is unwieldy, however, so we write directive files.
      These directive files are parsed by <code>HTMLPurifier_StringHashParser</code>
      into <code>HTMLPurifier_StringHash</code>es, which then
      are run through <code>HTMLPurifier_ConfigSchema_InterchangeBuilder</code>
      to construct the interchange object.
    </p>

    <p>
      From the interchange object, the data can be siphoned into other forms
      using <code>HTMLPurifier_ConfigSchema_Builder</code> subclasses.
      For example, <code>HTMLPurifier_ConfigSchema_Builder_ConfigSchema</code>
      generates a runtime <code>HTMLPurifier_ConfigSchema</code> object,
      which <code>HTMLPurifier_Config</code> uses to validate its incoming
      data. There is also an XML serializer, which is used to build documentation.
