By using this service, you agree that you will use any data presented for lawful purposes only and that under no circumstances will you use (a) data acquired for the purpose of allowing, enabling, or otherwise supporting the transmission by email, telephone, facsimile, or other communications mechanisms mass unsolicited, commercial, advertising, or solicitations to entities other than your existing customers; or (b) this service to enable high volume, automated, electronic processes that send queries or data to the systems of any registrar or any registry except as reasonably necessary to register domain names or to modify existing domain name registrations.
