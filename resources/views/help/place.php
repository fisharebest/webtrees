	<?= I18N::translate('Places should be entered according to the standards for genealogy. In genealogy, places are recorded with the most specific information about the place first and then working up to the least specific place last, using commas to separate the different place levels. The level at which you record the place information should represent the levels of government or church where vital records for that place are kept.<br><br>For example, a place like Salt Lake City would be entered as “Salt Lake City, Salt Lake, Utah, USA”.<br><br>Let’s examine each part of this place. The first part, “Salt Lake City,” is the city or township where the event occurred. In some countries, there may be municipalities or districts inside a city which are important to note. In that case, they should come before the city. The next part, “Salt Lake,” is the county. “Utah” is the state, and “USA” is the country. It is important to note each place because genealogy records are kept by the governments of each level.<br><br>If a level of the place is unknown, you should leave a space between the commas. Suppose, in the example above, you didn’t know the county for Salt Lake City. You should then record it like this: “Salt Lake City, , Utah, USA”. Suppose you only know that an individual was born in Utah. You would enter the information like this: “, , Utah, USA”. <br><br>You can use the <b>Find Place</b> link to help you find places that already exist in the database.') ?>
