The ZIP-file in this directory contains the geographic location of a large proportion of the towns in England. Other UK Ireland, Scotland, Wales) will be added later.

These files can be imported into the placelocation table of PGV though the option Admin - Edit geographic place locations - Import from file.

There is a single file for each county, as one for the whole of England would be too large to import in many systems, and may contain a lot of places not needed by some people.

The data for these files was taken initially from Wikipaedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_Kingdom_locations). However, that data relates to current day counties and administrative districts. It has therfore been converted to the county structures pre-1974, as defined by Chapman Codes.

Comments and issues:
1 - Chapman codes include the Isles of Scilly under Cornwall. Here they have a separate file - ENG-IOS_places.csv designating the Isles at a county level in the heirarchy
2 - Places in and around London (including Middlesex, Surrey, etc) are hard to pin down to a County, so there are very likely errors in these files.
3 - Yorkshire places are in a single file. No separate reference to the Ridings (NRY, WRY, ERY).
4 - If you find a county missing, its places could have been mistakenly included with another county. Please look at counties in that geographic area, and return any corrections you find.
5 - The heirarchy used in these files does NOT allow for UK as a top level. England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales are regarded as separate countries. If this is not your preferred heirarchy the files will need to be altered. Add UK at the front of (after the level indicator), and remove the  blank fourth level from the end of each record (but before the zoom factor).

If you use these files, and find errors or omissions, please send back a revised copy, so the changes can be incorporated for other users. Send files to admin@our-families.info
