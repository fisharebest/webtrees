HTML Purifier 4.6.0 is a major security release, fixing numerous bad
quadratic asymptotics in HTML Purifier's core algorithms.  Most users will
see a decent speedup on large inputs, although small inputs may take
longer.  Additionally, the secure URI munging algorithm has changed to
do a proper HMAC.  There are some other miscellaneous bugfixes as well.
