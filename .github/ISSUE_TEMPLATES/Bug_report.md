<!--
Thanks for reporting issues back to Webtrees!

Note: This is the **issue tracker of Webtrees**, please do NOT use this to get answers to your questions or get help for fixing your installation. This is a place to report bugs to developers, after your server has been debugged. You can find help debugging your system on our home user forums: https://www.webtrees.net/index.php/en/forum See also https://webtrees.net/faq/.

Webtrees is an open source project maintained by Greg Roach. Most of our volunteers are home users and thus primarily care about issues that affect home users.

Guidelines for submitting issues:

* Please search the existing issues first, it's likely that your issue was already reported or even fixed.
    - Go to https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees and type any word in the top search/command bar. You probably see something like "We couldn‚Äôt find any repositories matching ..." then click "Issues" in the left navigation.
    - You can also filter by appending e. g. "state:open" to the search string.
    - More info on search syntax within github: https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues

* SECURITY: Report any potential security bug to Greg Roach at greg@subaqua.co.uk instead of filing an issue in our bug tracker.
