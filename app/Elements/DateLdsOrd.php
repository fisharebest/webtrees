 * of day, month, and year. Only in rare instances is there a partial date. The
 * temple tag and code should always accompany temple ordinance dates.
 * Sometimes the LDS_(ordinance)_DATE_STATUS is used to indicate that an
 * ordinance date and temple code is not required, such as when BIC is used.
 * (See LDS_(ordinance)_DATE_STATUS definitions beginning on page 51.)
