 * credibility of a piece of information, based upon its supporting evidence.
 * Some systems use this feature to rank multiple conflicting opinions for
 * display of most likely information first. It is not intended to eliminate
 * the receiver's need to evaluate the evidence for themselves.
 * 0 = Unreliable evidence or estimated data
 * 1 = Questionable reliability of evidence (interviews, census, oral
 *     genealogies, or potential for bias for example, an autobiography)
 * 2 = Secondary evidence, data officially recorded sometime after event
 * 3 = Direct and primary evidence used, or by dominance of the evidence
