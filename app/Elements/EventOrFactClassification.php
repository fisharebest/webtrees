/**
 * EVENT_OR_FACT_CLASSIFICATION := {Size=1:90}
 * A descriptive word or phrase used to further classify the parent event or
 * attribute tag. This should be used whenever either of the generic EVEN or
 * FACT tags are used. The value of this primative is responsible for
 * classifying the generic event or fact being cited. For example, if the
 * attribute being defined was one of the persons skills, such as woodworking,
 * the FACT tag would have the value of `Woodworking', followed by a
 * subordinate TYPE tag with the value `Skills.'
 * 1 FACT Woodworking
 * 2 TYPE Skills
 * This groups the fact into a generic skills attribute, and in particular this
 * entry records the fact that this individual possessed the skill of
 * woodworking. Using the subordinate TYPE tag classification method with any
 * of the other defined event tags provides a further classification of the
 * parent tag but does not change the basic meaning of the parent tag. For
 * example, a MARR tag could be subordinated with a TYPE tag with an
 * EVENT_DESCRIPTOR value of `Common Law.'
 * 1 MARR
 * 2 TYPE Common Law
 * This classifies the entry as a common law marriage but the event is still a
 * marriage event. Other descriptor values might include, for example,
 * `stillborn' as a qualifier to BIRTh or `Tribal Custom' as a qualifier to
 * MARRiage.
