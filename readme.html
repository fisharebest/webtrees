<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<div style="float:left;"><a name="intro"><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3></a></div><div class="back"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div><div style="clear:both;"></div>
<b>webtrees</b> is the web's leading online collaborative genealogy application.
<ul>
	<li>It works from standard GEDCOM files, and is therefore compatible with every major desktop application.</li>
	<li>It aims to to be efficient and effective by using the right combination of third-party tools, design techniques and open standards.</li>
</ul>
<b>webtrees</b> allows you to view and edit your genealogy on your website. It has full editing capabilities, full privacy functions, and supports multimedia like photos and document images. As an on line program, it fosters extended family participation and good ancestral recording habits, as it simplifies the process of collaborating with others working on your family lines. Your latest information is always on your web site and available for others to see, defined by viewing rules you set. For more information and to see working demos, visit <a href="http://webtrees.net/">http://webtrees.net/ </a>. 
<br><br>
<b>webtrees</b> is Open Source software that has been produced by people from many countries freely donating their time and talents to the project. All service, support, and future development is dependent on the time developers are willing to donate to the project, often at the expense of work, recreation, and family. Beyond the few donations received from users, developers receive no compensation for the time they spend working on the project. There is also no outside source of revenue to support the project. Please consider these circumstances when making support requests and consider volunteering your own time and skills to make the project even stronger and better.
<br><br>
<hr width="100%">
<!-- SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS -->
<div style="float:left;"><a name="system"><h3>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</h3></a></div><div class="back"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div><div style="clear:both;"></div>
To install <b>webtrees</b>, you need:
<br>
<ul>
	<li>A webserver. Apache and IIS are the most common types. There are no requirements to use a specific type or version.</li>
	<li>Approximately 65MB of disk space for the application files, plus whatever is needed for your multi-media files, GEDCOM files and database.</li>
	<li>PHP 5.2.3 or later. Note that many web hosts offer *both* PHP4 and PHP5, typically with PHP4 as the default. If this is the case, you will be able to switch between the two using a control panel or a configuration file. Refer to your web host&#39;s support documentation for details.</li>
	 <ul>
		<li>PHP should be configured with the PHP/PDO library for MySQL. This is a server configuration option. It is enabled by default on most hosts. See <a href="http://php.net/pdo">http://php.net/pdo</a></li>
		<li>PHP should be configured to allow sufficient server resources (memory and execution time) for the size of your system. Typical requirements are:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Small systems (500 individuals): 16-32MB, 10-20 seconds</li>
				<li>Medium systems (5000 individuals): 32-64MB, 20-40 seconds</li>
				<li>Large systems (50000 individuals): 64-128MB, 40-80 seconds</li>
			</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>MySQL 5.0.13 or later. Note that <b>webtrees</b> can share a single database with other applications, by choosing a unique table prefix during configuration. If the number of databases is not restricted, you can set up a database purely for use by <b>webtrees</b> and create a separate user and password for only your genealogy.</li>
	<li>Internet browser compatability. <b>webtrees</b> supports the use of most current versions of open-source browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. We will do our best to support others such as Opera and Internet Explorer, though not their earlier versions. Currently many things do not work well in IE6, and some not in IE7 either. We strongly recommend anyone using these obsolete browsers upgrade as soon as possible. We are also aware that IE and Opera browsers provide poor RTL language support generally, so cannot recommend those for sites requiring RTL languages.</li>
	<li>To view sites that contain both left-to-right and right-to-left text (e.g. English data on Hebrew pages), you will need to use a browser that provides support for the HTML5 dir="auto" attribute. At present, only browsers based on the WebKit engine (Chrome and Safari) have this. The Gecko (Firefox) and Presto (Opera) engines promise to provide this soon.</li>
	<li>HTML Frames. Note that <b>webtrees</b> uses cookies to track login sessions. Sites that make <b>webtrees</b> pages available inside an HTML Frames will encounter problems with login for versions 7, 8, and 9 of Internet Explorer. IE users should review the Privacy settings Tools / Internet Options for more details.</li>
	</ul>
<hr width="100%">
<!-- INSTALLATION -->
<div style="float:left;"><a name="install"><h3>INSTALLATION</h3></a></div><div class="back"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div><div style="clear:both;"></div>
Installing <b>webtrees</b> is really easy. All you need is a webserver with PHP and MySQL. Almost every web hosting service provides these.
<br><br>
<ol>
	<li>Download the latest version of <b>webtrees</b> available from <a href="http://launchpad.net/webtrees">http://launchpad.net/webtrees</a></li>
	<li>Unzip the files and upload them to an empty directory on your web server.</li>
	<li>Open your web browser and type the URL for your <b>webtrees</b> site (for example, http://www.yourserver.com/webtrees) into the address bar.</li>
	<li>The <b>webtrees</b> setup wizard will start automatically. This will ask you a few questions about your server, and then generate a configuration file for you. At the end of the setup you will be asked to upload the configuration file to the webserver. This is a security check to make sure only the site owner can configure it.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it!</p>
<p>However, before you can use <b>webtrees</b>, you need one (or possibly more) GEDCOM (family tree) files. If you have been doing your research using a desktop program such as Family Tree Maker, you can use it's "save as GEDCOM" function to create a GEDCOM file. If you are starting from scratch, then <b>webtrees</b> can create a GEDCOM file for you. Alternatively, you can import data directly from PhpGedView.
<br><br>
So, after installation, you'll be directed to the GEDCOM (family tree) administration page, where you'll need to select one of the following options:
<ol>
	<li>On successful completion of all steps you will be taken to the GEDCOM (family tree) administration page where you can:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>UPLOAD a GEDCOM file from your local machine</li>
		<li>ADD a GEDCOM file from your server, (if your GEDCOM file is too large to upload, you can copy it to the webtrees/data folder, and load it from there)</li>
		<li>CREATE a new, empty GEDCOM file</li>
		<li>TRANSFER your existing PGV data straight into <b>webtrees</b>, using the PGV-to-<b>webtrees</b> wizard described in section 9 below: <a href="#convert">CONVERTING from PHPGEDVIEW</a></li>
	</ul>
</ol>
There are <i>lots</i> of configuration options. You'll probably want to review the privacy settings first. Don't worry too much about all the other options - the defaults are good for most people. If you get stuck, there's lots of built-in help and you can get friendly advice from the <a href="http://webtrees.net/forums">help</a> forum.
<hr width="100%">
<!-- UPGRADING -->
<div style="float:left;"><a name="upgrade"><h3>UPGRADING</h3></a></div><div class="back"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div><div style="clear:both;"></div>
Upgrading <b>webtrees</b> is quick and easy. It is strongly recommended that you upgrade your installation whenever a new version is made available. Even minor <b>webtrees</b> version updates usually contain a significant number of bug fixes as well as interface improvements and program enhancements.  The Administration page of your <b>webtrees</b> installation will display a notification whenever a new version is available.
<ol>
	<li>Now would be a good time to make a <a href="#backup">backup</a>. </li>
	<li>Download the latest version of <b>webtrees</b> available from <a href="http://launchpad.net/webtrees">http://launchpad.net/webtrees</a></li>
	<li><span style="color:red;">While you are in the middle of uploading the new files, a visitor to your site would encounter a mixture of new and old files.  This could cause unpredictable behaviour or errors.  To prevent this, create the file <b>data/offline.txt</b>.  While this file exists, visitors will see a "site unavailable - come back later" message.</span></li>
	<li>Unzip the .ZIP file, and upload the files to your web server, overwriting the existing files.</li>
	<li>Delete the file <b>data/offline.txt</b></li>
</ol>
<p><i>NOTE for Macintosh users. Step 4 assumes you are using a copy tool that <b>merges</b> directories rather than replaces them. (<b>Merge</b> is standard behaviour on Windows and Linux.) If you use the Macintosh Finder or other similar tool to perform step 3, it will <b>replace</b>  your configuration, media and other directories with the empty/default ones from the installation. This would be very bad (but you did take a backup in step 1, didn't you!). Further details and recommendations for suitable tools can be found by searching <a href="http://google.com">google.com</a></i></p>
<p><i>NOTE for anyone using custom code (modules, themes, etc.). It is <u>very likely</u> that your custom code will not work when you upgrade <b>webtrees</b>. <span style="color:red;">We recommend that you disable all custom code before you apply the upgrade.</span> Disable custom modules, switch over to a standard theme, and remove any code "hacks". Once the upgrade is complete and you are satisfied your site is fully operational contact the source of those modules or themes for a new version.</i></p>
<p><i>GENERAL NOTE: Depending on the changes in the new files, your browser configuration and possibly other factors, it is always wise to clear both the <b>webtrees</b> cache and your browser cache immediately after the upgrade is completed. The <b>webtrees</b> cache can be cleared simply by going to Administration -> Cleanup data directory and deleting the cache.</i></p>
If you have any problems or questions, help is available on the <a href="http://webtrees.net/forums">webtrees forum</a>.

<!-- GEDCOM FILES -->
<div style="float:left;"><a name="gedcom"><h3>GEDCOM (family tree) FILES</h3></a></div><div class="back"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div><div style="clear:both;"></div>
When you ADD, IMPORT or UPLOAD a family tree (GEDCOM) file in <b>webtrees</b> the data from the file is all transferred to the database tables. The file itself is no longer used or required by <b>webtrees</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>If you use ADD or IMPORT, your file remains in the webtrees/data folder you first copied it to, and will not be changed by any subsequent editing of the <b>webtrees</b> data.</li>
	<li>If you use UPLOAD, the file is left in its original location, and again remains untouched.</li>
</ul>
<br>
When or if you change your genealogy data outside of <b>webtrees</b>, it is not necessary to delete your GEDCOM file or database from <b>webtrees</b> and start over.  Follow these steps to update a GEDCOM that has already been imported:
<ol>
	<li>Decide if you want to IMPORT or UPLOAD your new GEDCOM file.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Use UPLOAD if your family tree file is smaller than your server's PHP file upload limit (often 2MB).The new file can have any name you choose.</li>
			<li>Use IMPORT for larger files. In this case you need to use FTP to first copy your file to the webtrees/data folder. Either copy over the existing file, or use a different name.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>From the Administration page, go to your <b>webtrees</b> Family trees (GEDCOM) configuration page. On the line  relating to this particular family tree (GEDCOM) file (or a new one) click either IMPORT or UPLOAD.</li>
	<li>Take careful note of the media items option (<i>"If you have created media objects in <b>webtrees</b>, and have edited your gedcom off-line using a program that deletes media objects, then tick this box to merge the current media objects with the new GEDCOM."</i>) In most cases you should leave this box <b>UNCHECKED</b>.</li>
	<li>Click "SAVE". <b>webtrees</b> will validate the GEDCOM again before importing. During this process, <b>webtrees</b> copies your entire family tree (GEDCOM file) to a 'chunk' table within your database. Depending on the coding of your file, its file size and the capabilities of your server and the supporting software, this may take some time. <b>No progress bar will show while the data is being copied</b> and should you navigate away from this page, the process is suspended. It will start again when you return to the Family Tree management page.</li>
	<li><strike>You can use a ZIP file to upload the GEDCOM, but only if you use the UPLOAD option. The filename can be anything you choose.</strike> NOTE: The ability to upload ZIP files does not currently work. If your GEDCOM file is too large to upload, you should use the IMPORT option.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>FORMAT</b></p>
Every Family History program has its own method of creating GEDCOM files, and differing output format options to select from. <b>webtrees'</b> import routines can read many different formats, but not necessarily all. If your software has a "UTF8" option you should always use that. However, <b>webtrees</b> has been tested with these alternative formats:
<ul>
	<li>ANSI - imports OK, but is slow due to the translation into UTF8 as part of the import process.</li>
	<li>MAC - imports OK, but is slow due to the translation into UTF8 as part of the import process.</li>
	<li>DOS - imports OK, but is slow due to the translation into UTF8 as part of the import process.</li>
	<li>ANSEL - currently will not import. Gives warning <em>Error: cannot convert GEDCOM file from ANSEL encoding to UTF-8 encoding.</em> Later releases of <b>webtrees</b> may include translation from ANSEL to UTF8, but this is not a simple process.</li?
</ul>
<hr width="100%">
<!-- SECURITY -->
<div style="float:left;"><a name="security"><h3>SECURITY</h3></a></div><div class="back"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div><div style="clear:both;"></div>
<b>Security in <i>webtrees</i> means ensuring your site is safe from unwanted intrusions, hacking, or access to data and configuration files. The developers of <i>webtrees</i> regard security as an extremely important part of its development and have made every attempt to ensure your data is safe.</b>
<br><br>
The area most at risk of intrusion would be the /data folder that contains your config.ini.php file, and various temporary files. If you are concerned there may be a risk there is a very simple test you can do: try to fetch <b>config.ini.php</b> by typing <b>http:// </b><i>url to your site</i><b> /data/config.ini.php</b> in your web browser. 
<br><br>
The most likely result is an "access denied" message like this:
<table border="1px" cellpadding="5px" cellspacing="0">
	<tr>
		<td>
			<font size="4"><b>Forbidden</b></font><br><br>You don't have permission to access /data/xxxx.ged on this server.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>
This indicates that the protection built into <b>webtrees</b> is working, and no further action is required.
<br><br>
In the unlikely event you do fetch the file (you will just see a semicolon), then that protection is not working on your site and you should take some further action.
<br><br>
If your server runs PHP in CGI mode, then change the permission of the /data directory to 700 instead of 777. This will block access to the httpd process, while still allowing access to PHP scripts.
<br><br>
This will work for perhaps 99% of all users. Only the remaining 1% should consider the most complex solution, moving the /data/ directory out of accessible web space. (<b><i>Note:</i></b> In many shared hosting environments this is not an option anyway.)
<br><br><br>
If you do find it necessary, following is an example of the process required:
<br><br>
If your home directory is something like <b>/home/username</b>,
and the root directory for your web site is <b>/home/username/public_html</b>,
and you have installed <b>webtrees</b> in the <b>public_html/webtrees</b> directory,
then you would create a new <b>data</b> folder in your home directory at the same level as your public_html directory, such as <b>/home/username/private/data</b>, and place your GEDCOM (family tree) file there.

Then change the <b>Data file directory</b> setting on the Admin --> Site Administration page from the default <b>data/</b> to the new location <b>/home/username/private/data</b>

You will have <b>two</b> data directories:
<ul>
	<li>[path to webtrees]/data - just needs to contain config.ini.php</li>
	<li>/home/username/private/data - contains everything else</li>
</ul>
<b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)</b>
<br><br>
<b>webtrees</b> supports https access. If your website is configured with mandatory or optional https support <b>webtrees</b> will operate correctly in either mode.<br><br>
If your website is configured with optional https support, <b>webtrees</b> can be configured to switch to https at login. To enable https at login, set the Login URL setting on the Admin --> Site Administration --> Configuration page to your https login URL, which is often in the form https://example.com/admin.php (substitute your domain for example.com). Warning: misconfiguration can disable your login links. If this occurs, access the login by typing the correct URL directly into your browser's address input.
<hr width="100%">
<!-- BACKUP -->
<div style="float:left;"><a name="backup"><h3>BACKUP</h3></a></div><div class="back"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div><div style="clear:both;"></div>
Backups are good. Whatever problem you have, it can always be fixed from a good backup.
<br><br>
To make a backup of webtrees, you need to make a copy of the following
<ol>
   <li>The files in the webtrees/data directory.</li>
   <li>The files in the webtrees/media directory.</li>
   <li>The tables in the database. Freely available tools such as phpMyAdmin allow you to do this in one click.</li> 
</ol>
Remember that most web hosting services do NOT backup your data, and this is your responsibility.
<hr width="100%">
<!-- CONVERSION -->
<div style="float:left;"><a name="convert"><h3>CONVERTING from PHPGEDVIEW</h3></a></div><div class="back"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div><div style="clear:both;"></div>
If you are moving to <b>webtrees</b> from an existing PhpGedView ("PGV") setup, and your PGV install meets certain requirements, <b>webtrees</b> has provided a "wizard" to help make the transfer of the majority of your data a relatively quick and painless operation. See exceptions noted below. Please note that we have designed this wizard so as to not disturb your existing PGV installation, leaving all those settings, data and your website intact and fully functional.
<br><br>
The requirements are:
<ul>
	<li>The PGV database and index directory must be on the same server as <b>webtrees</b>.</li>
	<li>Your <b>webtrees</b> MySQL database username and password must either be the same as your PGV username and password, or if you created a new user for <b>webtrees</b>, that new user must also have full privileges to access your PGV database.</li>
	<li>PGV must be version 4.2.3 or 4.2.4 (this corresponds to an internal "PGV_SCHEMA_VERSION" of between 10 and 14).  Newer versions, including the current version 4.3 SVN work too, and later versions, should they be released, will probably work, provided the data structures do not change;</li>
	<li>All changes in PGV must be accepted (as pending edits will not be transfered).</li>
	<li>All existing PGV users must have an email address, and it must be unique to that user (PGV allows users to delete their email address, or have the same email address as other users;  <b>webtrees</b> requires that all users have their own unique email address).</li>
	<li>The wizard transfer process overwrites the username and password you may have entered in setting up the initial admin account. The main administration user name and password in <b>webtrees</b> will be identical to the admin user name and password from PGV after running the wizard. Once done, you can change it back if desired.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Warning:</b> Please read the <a href="http://wiki.webtrees.net/Category:FAQs#Importing_data_from_PhpGedView"><b>webtrees</b> FAQ section on importing from PhpGedView</a> before doing a transfer as important pre-processing steps and known issues may be outlined there.</p>
<p><b>Important Note:</b> This transfer wizard is not able to assist with moving media items. You will need to set up and move or copy your media configuration and objects separately after the transfer wizard is finished. If you use the media firewall in PGV with a directory outside the PGV root, then duplicating the media configuration in <b>webtrees</b> to use the same firewall directory should make your media available in <b>webtrees</b>.</p>
<p>After the transfer is complete, you should check your family tree configuration and privacy settings. Due to differences in internal data formats, the following settings are not yet transfered: custom privacy restrictions, block configuration, FAQs, and HTML blocks.  We hope to add these to the wizard in a future release.</p>
<p><b>Custom privacy restrictions, block configuration, FAQs and HTML blocks</b></p>
<p>We hope to add these to the wizard in a future release. Otherwise, read the <a href="http://wiki.webtrees.net/Category:FAQs#Importing_data_from_PhpGedView">FAQ section on importing from PhpGedView</a> before reporting a problem in the forum.</p>
<p>The transfer wizard is accessed in <b>webtrees</b> from the bottom of the "Manage family trees" page to which you will be automatically directed once you have completed the initial <b>webtrees</b> installation steps (section 4 above: <a href="#install">INSTALLATION</a>).This option is only available on a new, empty <b>webtrees</b> installation; once you have created a GEDCOM (family tree) or added user accounts, it will no longer be available.</p>
