10-11-2013 Version 1.5.0 for webtrees 1.5.0

* Updated several functions in order to use this module with webtrees 1.5.0
* New theme options added:
  - Set media menu as main menu item and use media folders as submenu links (only 1 level submenus supported at the moment);
  - Use google docs viewer for pdf's. Advantages: watermarked pdf's and quicker loading.

* Removed third parameter ($type) from function searchArray. It is no longer needed.
* Bug solved: When activating a menu-module after theme options are set, the menu won't show up. Fixed.
