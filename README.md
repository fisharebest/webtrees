## Introduction

**webtrees** is the web's leading online collaborative genealogy application.

* It works from standard GEDCOM files, and is therefore compatible with every
major desktop application.
* It aims to to be efficient and effective by using the right combination of
third-party tools, design techniques and open standards.

**webtrees** allows you to view and edit your genealogy on your website. It has
full editing capabilities, full privacy functions, and supports imedia such as
photos and document images. As an online program, it fosters extended family
participation and good ancestral recording habits, as it simplifies the process
of collaborating with others working on your family lines. Your latest information
is always on your web site and available for others to see, defined by viewing
rules you set. For more information and to see working demos, visit
[webtrees.net](https://webtrees.net/).

**webtrees** is Open Source software that has been produced by people from many
countries freely donating their time and talents to the project. All service,
support, and future development is dependent on the time developers are willing
to donate to the project, often at the expense of work, recreation, and family.
Beyond the few donations received from users, developers receive no compensation
for the time they spend working on the project. There is also no outside source
of revenue to support the project. Please consider these circumstances when
making support requests and consider volunteering your own time and skills to make
the project even stronger and better.


## System requirements

To install **webtrees**, you need:

* A webserver. Apache, NGINX and IIS are the most common types. To use “Pretty URLs”, you will need to configure URL rewriting"
* A database.  MySQL is recommended, although PostgreSQL, SQL-Server and SQLite can be used.  Some features rely on MySQL for collation.  Other database might not sort names according to local rules.  **webtrees** uses a prefix for its table names, so you can install several instances of webtrees in the same database.
* Approximately 100MB of disk space for the application files, plus whatever is
  needed for your media files, GEDCOM files and database.
* PHP 7.1 - 7.4.  Servers with PHP 5.3 - 7.0 can use **webtrees** 1.7.
   * PHP should be configured to allow sufficient server resources (memory and
     execution time) for the size of your system. Typical requirements are:
      * Small systems (500 individuals): 16–32 MB, 10–20 seconds
      * Medium systems (5,000 individuals): 32–64 MB, 20–40 seconds
      * Large systems (50,000 individuals): 64–128 MB, 40–80 seconds

## Browser compatibility
  
  **webtrees** is tested on recent versions of popular browsers such as Edge, Firefox,
  Chrome, and Safari.  Support for other browsers and older versions is on a case-by-case basis.

## Installation

1. Download the .ZIP file for latest stable version from [github.com](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees/releases/latest)
2. Unzip the files and then upload them to an empty folder on your web server.
3. Open your web browser and type the URL for your **webtrees** site (for example,
   ``http://www.yourserver.com/webtrees`` into the address bar.
4. The **webtrees** setup wizard will start automatically.

Your first task will be to create a family tree.

If you have a GEDCOM file, you can import it into the tree.  If not, just start
entering your family tree. 

There are lots of configuration options. You'll probably want to review the
privacy settings first. Don't worry too much about all the other options - the
defaults are good for most people. If you get stuck, you can get friendly help
and advice from the [help](https://webtrees.net/forums) forum.


## Upgrading

Upgrading **webtrees** is quick and easy. It is strongly recommended that you
upgrade your installation whenever a new version is made available. Even minor
**webtrees** version updates usually contain a significant number of bug fixes
as well as interface improvements and program enhancements.

* **Automatic upgrade**

  **webtrees** has an automatic upgrade facility. An administrator upon logging in
will receive notification when a new version is available and an option to start
the automatic upgrade. If for some reason the automatic upgrade should fail
then a manual upgrade should be performed.

* **Manual upgrade**

  1. Now would be a good time to make a [backup](#backup).
  2. Download the latest version of **webtrees** available from
   [webtrees.net](https://webtrees.net/)
  3. While you are in the middle of uploading the new files,
   a visitor to your site would encounter a mixture of new and old files.  This
   could cause unpredictable behavior or errors.  To prevent this, create the
   file **data/offline.txt**.  While this file exists, visitors will see a
   “site unavailable - come back later” message.
  4. Unzip the .ZIP file, and upload the files to your web server, overwriting the existing files.
  5. Delete the file **data/offline.txt**


### Note for Macintosh users

Step 4 assumes you are using a copy tool that **merges** directories rather than
replaces them. (**Merge** is standard behavior on Windows and Linux.) If you use
the Macintosh Finder or other similar tool to perform step 3, it will **replace**
your configuration, media and other directories with the empty/default ones from
the installation. This would be very bad (but you did take a backup in step 1,
didn't you!). Further details and recommendations for suitable tools can be found
by searching [google.com](http://google.com).


## Building and developing

If you want to build webtrees from source, or modify the code, you'll need to install
a couple of tools first.

You will need [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install the PHP dependencies.
Then run this command::

* php composer.phar install

You will need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to install the Javascript dependencies.
Then run the commands:

* npm install
* npm run production

You will need to re-run the second of these any time you modify the file `webtrees.js`.

## Gedcom (family tree) files

When you import a family tree (GEDCOM) file in **webtrees** the
data from the file is transferred to the database tables. The file itself 
remains in the **webtrees/data** folder and is no longer used or required
by **webtrees**. Any subsequent editing of the **webtrees** data
will not change this file

When or if you change your genealogy data outside of **webtrees**, it is not
necessary to delete your GEDCOM file or database from **webtrees** and start
over. Follow these steps to update a GEDCOM that has already been imported:

* Go to ``Control panel`` -> ``Manage family trees`` On the line relating to this particular family tree (GEDCOM)
  file (or a new one) select IMPORT.
* Take careful note of the media items option (_“If you have created media objects
  in **webtrees**, and have edited your data off-line using software that
  deletes media objects, then tick this box to merge the current media objects
  with the new GEDCOM.”_) In most cases you should leave this box **UNCHECKED**.
* Click “SAVE”. **webtrees** will validate the GEDCOM again before importing.
  During this process, **webtrees** copies your entire family tree (GEDCOM file)
  to a 'chunk' table within your database. Depending on the coding of your file,
  its file size and the capabilities of your server and the supporting software,
  this may take some time. **No progress bar will show while the data is being
  copied** and should you navigate away from this page, the process is suspended.
  It will start again when you return to the Family Tree management page.


### Gedcom file Formats

Every Family History program has its own method of creating GEDCOM files, and
differing output format options to select from. **webtrees'** import routines
can read many different formats, but not necessarily all. If your software has
a “UTF8” option you should always use that. However, **webtrees** has been
tested with these alternative formats:

* ANSI
   * imports OK, but is slow due to the translation into UTF8 as part
     of the import process.
* MAC
   * imports OK, but is slow due to the translation into UTF8 as part
     of the import process.
* DOS
   * imports OK, but is slow due to the translation into UTF8 as part
     of the import process.
* ANSEL
   * currently will not import. Gives warning *Error: cannot convert
     GEDCOM file from ANSEL encoding to UTF-8 encoding*. Later releases
     of **webtrees** may include the facility to translate from ANSEL to UTF8,
     but for now a standalone utility [is available here](https://dev.webtrees.net/ansel/)
     and should be used to convert the format to UTF-8 prior to importing.


## Security

**Security** in _webtrees_ means ensuring your site is safe from unwanted
intrusions, hacking, or access to data and configuration files. The developers
of _webtrees_ regard security as an extremely important part of its development
and have made every attempt to ensure your data is safe.

The area most at risk of intrusion would be the **/data** folder that contains your
config.ini.php file, and various temporary files. If you are concerned there
may be a risk there is a very simple test you can do: try to fetch the file 
config.ini.php by typing **``url_to_your_server/data/config.ini.php``** in your web
browser.

The most likely result is an “access denied” message like this:

    Forbidden

    You don't have permission to access /data/config.ini.php on this server.

This indicates that the protection built into **webtrees** is working, and no
further action is required.

In the unlikely event you do fetch the file (you will just see a semicolon),
then that protection is not working on your site and you should take some further
action.

If your server runs PHP in CGI mode, then change the permission of the **/data**
folder to 700 instead of 777. This will block access to the httpd process,
while still allowing access to PHP scripts.

This will work for perhaps 99% of all users. Only the remaining 1% should consider
the most complex solution, moving the **/data** folder out of accessible web
space. (**_Note:_** In many shared hosting environments this is not an option anyway.)

If you do find it necessary, following is an example of the process required:

If your home folder is something like **/home/username**,
and the root folder for your web site is **/home/username/public_html**,
and you have installed **webtrees** in the **public_html/webtrees** folder,
then you would create a new **data** folder in your home folder at the same
level as your public_html folder, such as **/home/username/private/data**,
and place your GEDCOM (family tree) file there.

Then change the **Data folder** setting on the ``Control panel`` ->
``Website`` -> ``Website preferences`` page from the default **data/** to the new
location **/home/username/private/data**

You will have **two** data directories:

* [path to webtrees]/data - just needs to contain config.ini.php
* /home/username/private/data - contains everything else


## Backup

Backups are good. Whatever problem you have, it can always be fixed from a good
backup.

To make a backup of **webtrees**, you need to make a copy of the following

1. The files in the *webtrees/data* folder.
2. The files in the *webtrees/media* folder.
3. The tables in the database. Freely available tools such as
   [phpMyAdmin](http://www.phpmyadmin.net) allow you to do this in one click.

Remember that most web hosting services do NOT backup your data, and this is
your responsibility.
